# New Frontend Project Completed The 3-Column Preview Card Component

Just wrapped up another Frontend Mentor challenge and this time I worked on a sleek three-column preview card layout.

## What I did:

    •	Built a clean, responsive layout with HTML & CSS
    •	Used color-coded sections (Sedans, SUVs, Luxury) to create a clear visual hierarchy
    •	Practiced layout positioning and styling using relative positioning for each column
    •	Enhanced typography and spacing to keep everything easy to read and balanced
    •	Added custom-styled “Learn More” buttons with different color themes for each category

## What I learned / improved on:

    •	How to arrange multiple columns and control their alignment
    •	Balancing colors and typography to achieve a modern, attractive look
    •	Strengthened my knowledge of CSS positioning (relative positioning in this case)

## Challenge:

This one was all about nailing the design exactly as provided in the challenge while practicing writing clean, maintainable CSS. It gave me a better feel for breaking a design into reusable components and sections.

#I’m loving how each challenge adds a new layer of skill to my frontend journey, one project at a time!
